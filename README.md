# LEARN

We are always learning here on Quave. We love to code and we also love to learn!

## Getting started

### Required Knowledge

#### Javascript Basics

#### Shell basics
- zsh

#### Git basics
- use ssh authentication
    - ssh-keygen > enter > enter > enter
    - cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
    - copy this text
    - paste on GitHub > Settings > SSH Keys > Choose a title and paste the key. Save
    - now you should be able to clone repositories and execute git commands using git@... instead of https:// in the remote repo.

#### IDE
- Use WebStorm (VSCode is amazing but not for production apps, a [few reasons](https://medium.com/@filipenevola/vscode-missing-features-837a6bd660ca))
    - Disable auto-save on WebStorm so you are not going to rebuild your app all the time
      ![System settings](images/disable-auto-save-system-settings.png)
      ![System settings](images/disable-auto-save-editor-tabs.png)
    - You are going to have * in your file when it is changed but not saved yet.
